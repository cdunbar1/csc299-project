## 2025-09-20 Create a Python program for a hangman game

### User

in my coding class he used AI to code a tic tac toe game using Python. what are other examples similar to tic tac toe that i can ask for you to write python code for me? the assignement is to try coding with AI and edit it with AI's help

### Assistant

That's a great assignment! Here are a few other simple, classic games and programs that are excellent for practicing basic coding concepts, similar to Tic-Tac-Toe:

Hangman: A word-guessing game that involves loops, conditional statements, and managing lists of letters.

Rock, Paper, Scissors: A very straightforward game that's perfect for learning about random number generation and if/else logic.

Connect Four: This is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe but on a larger board and with a different win condition, which is a good challenge for array or list manipulation.

A Number Guessing Game: The computer chooses a random number, and the player gets clues like "higher" or "lower" until they guess it correctly.

These are all great choices for using AI to generate a first draft that you can then edit and improve. Let me know which one you'd like me to start with!

does gemini have an extension i can pair on vs code?

### Assistant

Yes, Gemini has official integrations with Visual Studio Code. The main extension is called Gemini Code Assist, which provides a range of AI-powered features directly within the IDE, such as code completion, code generation from comments or prompts, and a chat interface that understands your project's context.


Additionally, there's an extension called Gemini CLI Companion, which pairs with the Gemini command-line tool to bring features like native in-editor diffing and awareness of your open files to the terminal experience.

These tools are designed to help you write, debug, and refactor code more efficiently.

What specific coding tasks are you interested in using a Gemini extension for?

### User

okay thanks! can you write a simple hangman code using Python

### Assistant

Great choice! Hangman is a classic. It's a fantastic project for learning about loops, conditional statements, and string/list manipulation in Python.

I've put together a Python file with a complete, runnable version of the game. It includes comments to help you understand each part of the code.

'''Hangman Code''' 

This code is a solid starting point. You can run it as is, but the real fun begins when you start to customize and improve it.

A few ideas for you to consider:

Make it look better: You could use ASCII art to display the hangman as attempts are used up.

Add more words: The current word list is short. You could add more words or even create a separate text file to read words from.

Keep a score: Add a scoring system for correct and incorrect guesses.

Feel free to experiment with this draft! Let me know if you would like me to help with any of the suggestions above.
